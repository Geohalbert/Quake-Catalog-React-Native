  Quake Catalog Mobile
</h1>

This is a react-native rendition of my "quake catalog" web app. Instead of using mongoDB and redux, this app will use firebase and mobx.

Using my former mentor's [React Native starter app](https://github.com/alexwasner/react-native-mobx-firebase-starter) with Wix React Native Navigation V2, MobX, Lottie, Firebase and more...

Architecture includes navigation, registering and login with Firebase and Lottie animations.
